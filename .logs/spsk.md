## Day 1 - 31th July, 2021
Discussion about what to do, and how to proceed. 

Decided that we would do a website with basic functionality, with not that much CSS. 
Django is going to act as the framework. 

We decided to split the work, there are two parts, consumer and vendor.
I am taking care of the vendor's and functionality for vendors in the website.
We planned to ask the vendors what it is that they expect in a website.

Discussion was fine but there was zero progress made affter the discussion.

We also planned for a survey.
