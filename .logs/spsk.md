## Day 1 - 31th July, 2021
Discussion about what to do, and how to proceed. 

Decided that we would do a website with basic functionality, with not that much CSS. 
Django is going to act as the framework. 

We decided to split the work, there are two parts, consumer and vendor.
I am taking care of the vendor's and functionality for vendors in the website.
We planned to ask the vendors what it is that they expect in a website.

Discussion was fine but there was zero progress made affter the discussion.

We also planned for a survey.

## Day 2 - 1st August, 2021
Discussion weather to open it up as a buisness or just to implement all the features.

Asked Vandana for an opinion.
We were just analysing the problem of large scale deployment.

It just was not feasible.
Next time I need to start off with a buisness model and then decide the rest.

Problems that we would face upon large scale implementation:
- Delivery Issue
- Not that much profitable
- Our targets are small vendors, will they be able to afford the online services.
- Will our website have a reach 
- will customer's be satisfied with the order
- Will our website have a reach 

The list of problems kept on increasing as we thaught about it.
So we decided to leave that part aside and start working on the website.

Spent a lot of time thinking(till 3am) about the possible solutions for the problems.
But there doesn't seem to an end to the problem list.
So I just taught about a name for the website.

I came up with NotAmazon, but NozamatoN, the reverse of NotAmazon sounded more intriguing.
I have suggested it to theni, lets see how he reacts to it.

## Day 3 - 2nd August, 2021
